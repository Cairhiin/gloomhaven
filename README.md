## Purpose
Implementing UI/UX design principles

## Instructions and scope
Make certain you are running the newest Flutter version as the header text uses a drop shadow that is not supported by some of older versions of Flutter. 

## Features
The native prototype implements the following features:

### The landing page. 
Clicking on the LOG IN will redirect you to the Dashboard.

### The Dashboard page.
Both the stats and achievement tab are implemented. Clicking on the statistics or achievement button will switch between the tabs. Clicking on the sign out or HOME button will redirect back to the landing page.

### The To Top floating action button.
Clicking on the To Top button will scroll the view back to the top.

### The fat menu.
Clicking on the FEATURES button in the top navigation will open or close the Fat Menu.
